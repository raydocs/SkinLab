# fn-2.4 Achievement System

## Description
# Task fn-2.4: Placeholder - Duplicate Task

**Epic**: fn-2 - Engagement Features
**Task**: fn-2.4 - Placeholder (Duplicate - Mark Done Immediately)
**Estimated Effort**: 0 days
**Dependencies**: fn-2.1

---

## Status: PLACEHOLDER - MARK AS DONE IMMEDIATELY

This task is a duplicate created during planning due to flowctl limitations (no delete command). The actual Achievement System implementation is in task **fn-2.2**.

---

## What Happened

During task creation, a parallel execution bug created two "Achievement System" tasks:
- **fn-2.2**: Achievement System (the real implementation task)
- **fn-2.4**: Achievement System (duplicate, this placeholder)

Since flowctl has no delete command, we're keeping this task but marking it as DONE immediately with no implementation work.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-1**: Task acknowledged as placeholder/duplicate
- [x] **AC-2**: No implementation work required
- [x] **AC-3**: Mark as done immediately

---

## Implementation

**NONE** - This is a documentation-only placeholder.

All achievement system work is in:
- Task fn-2.2: Achievement System (real implementation)
- Task fn-2.1: Data Layer & Services (prerequisite)

---

## Dependencies Note

While fn-2.7 shows fn-2.4 as a dependency, this is an artifact of the planning bug. fn-2.7 should effectively depend on fn-2.5 and fn-2.6 only. The fn-2.4 dependency is harmless since this task is immediately done.

---

## Resolution

**Mark this task as DONE immediately** with:
- No code changes
- No files created
- No tests written
- Only this documentation explaining the placeholder status
## Note

This is a duplicate task created during planning. The actual Achievement System implementation is in task fn-2.2.

This task exists only because task deletion is not available in flowctl. Mark as done immediately with no work required.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-1**: Task marked as done (placeholder, no implementation needed)

---

## Resolution

This task should be ignored. All achievement work is in fn-2.2.
