    "description": "Niacinamide (also known as vitamin B3 or nicotinamide) is a unique skin-restoring ingredient that offers a multitude of benefits for skin. It is best known for its ability to help visibly reduce enlarged pores and improve uneven/dull skin tone. It also strengthens a weakened skin barrier. An advantage of niacinamide's antioxidant power is that it can help visibly repair damage from UV light while offsetting other sources of environmental attack. Another helpful benefit is that niacinamide helps fortify skin's surface against moisture loss and dehydration by boosting its natural production of skin-strengthening ceramides. Studies have also shown niacinamide has a positive effect on reducing wrinkles. Unlike many superstar anti-aging ingredients, niacinamide is stable in the presence of heat and light. It is water soluble and presents as colorless needles or white crystalline powder in material state. Niacinamide offers benefits for skin starting in concentrations as low 0.2%, and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded it is safe in concentrations all the way up to 20%.",
